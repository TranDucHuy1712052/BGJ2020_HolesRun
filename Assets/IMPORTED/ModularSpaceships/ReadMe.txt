Version 1.5 Changes:

-Added more examples for each spaceship.

-Added 2 different colors per spacepship.

-Added Sci-Fi Alien spaceships to the collection.

-Added 2 Bonus items: arcade generic spaceships and flying insects. (Note: flying insects are only added as a free bonus to use inside an arcade themed space shooter game, the wings are not rigged for animation!).

-Improved textures: the textures are now much more unified and of a higher quality. WE HAVE COMPLETELY RE-TEXTURED ALL OF THE SHIPS adding details in the process. we hope you can notice the quality improvement.

-Unified all metallic/smoothness values for all of the textures so that the assets are more unified inside your game.

-Added text next to each spaceship so you can easily know the spaceships name and look it up in the folders.

-Changed naming conventions and folder orgnization. Now it's easier to know which material belongs to which asset and you can grab the spaceships examples prefabs more quickly, the modules prefabs are named after the spaceships title.

-All albedo textures are now viewable inside Photoshop.

-Updated the FBX files inside meshes folder.

-Added all of the spaceships examples in modular form as well as the single gameobject form.
